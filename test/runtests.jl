    # The wrapper types (`QuantumCircuit`, `Target`, `TargetEntry`,
    # `SparseObservable`, transpile layouts) register finalizers that call the
    # corresponding `qk_*_free` C functions. Those finalizer bodies only run
    # when the garbage collector reclaims the objects, which is nondeterministic
    # and may not happen before the test process exits — leaving the free paths
    # showing as uncovered (and inconsistently so across CI matrix jobs). Force
    # a collection here so the finalizers run deterministically.
